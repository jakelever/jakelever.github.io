Below are curriculums that I've developed for machine learning and data science audiences.

### Data Science Miniclass on Bootstrapping

This short class outlines the bootstrapping method with an associated Jupyter notebook to provide example code.

### [Intermediate Python: Machine Learning](https://jakelever.github.io/swc-machine-learning-short/)

As part of Stanford's Software Carpentry program, I developed this intermediate Python course to provide learner's a path past the core Software Carpentry curriculum. This short programme provides an introduction to unsupervised and supervised learning using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

### [Introduction to Unix Shell (with a mystery story)](https://jakelever.github.io/shell-novice-adventure/)

For a Software Carpentry program, I created this version of their core Unix Shell program which uses a mystery narrative to engage the learners. The learners must learn and use their Unix skills to explore the contents of a fictional computer to solve the mystery of a missing person. It introduces core navigation, file interaction, and search skills.
