I've contributed several columns to the Nature Methods [Points of Significance](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance) column on statistics.

### [Logistic regression](http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3904)
Regression can be used on categorical responses to estimate probabilities and to classify.

### [Classification evaluation](http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3945)
It is important to understand both what a classification metric expresses and what it hides.

### [Model selection and overfitting](http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3968)
"With four parameters I can fit an elephant and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk". John von Neumann

### [Regularization](http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4014)
Constraining the magnitude of parameters of a model can control its complexity

### [Principal component analysis](http://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4346)
PCA helps you interpret your data, but it will not always find the important patterns.
