Iâ€™m always looking for potential new researchers to work with. Take a look below for information for PhDs, postdocs and undergraduates. Please email me at [Jake.Lever@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:Jake.Lever@glasgow.ac.uk). I apologise but I likely won't respond to emails that resemble bulk mailings.

#### Prospective PhD Students

Want to do a PhD using machine learning to solve some exciting biomedical problems, particularly related to biomedical text? The School of Computing Science has a webpage on the main route into the PhD programme. [Please read it to understand the application process](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents). The next deadline for applications is **31st January 2022**.

The School has a number of studentships and, unfortunately, only a limited number cover fees for international students. [This page](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/phd-projects/) lists most of them out and you apply for many of them in the same process as applying for the PhD programme.

If you are considering applying, please email me early so we have time to chat about working together and about potential research projects.

Occasionally, I will have PhD opportunities through other mechanisms but do not at the moment.

#### Prospective Postdocs & Staff

Unfortunately, I don't have any advertised positions at the moment. However, I would love to hear from you so that I can let you know about any future positions. Please drop me an email.

#### University of Glasgow Undergraduates and Masters Students

I really enjoy working with undergraduates and masters students on their degree projects. If you have a particular idea, or just want to discuss potential research directions, please do contact me.
