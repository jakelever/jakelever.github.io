Hi, I'm Jake Lever, a lecturer in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). My research focuses on biomedical text mining and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in extracting biomedical knowledge from text (e.g. research papers) to make it easier for scientists to find the information they need.

I co-lead the [Glasgow AI4BioMed Lab](https://ai4biomed.org/), where we work on natural language processing, knowledge graphs, language models, and more to extract and infer biomedical knowledge. If you'd be interested in working with us, please take a look at [this page](https://ai4biomed.org/work_with_us/) on the lab website.
