Hi, I'm Jake Lever, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Helix Group](http://helix.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. My research focuses on extracting biomedical knowledge from published research to make it easier for scientists to find the information they need.

This personal web page provides links to my [teaching](/teaching/) and [research](/research/) efforts. I've also written a few columns on statistics that are linked in the [writing](/writing/) page.

### Current Research Focus: 

[CoronaCentral](https://coronacentral.ai) - A portal to the coronavirus research literature using machine learning to categorize all research in useful topics. Updated daily.
