Hi, I'm Jake Lever, a lecturer in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). My research focuses on biomedical text mining and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in extracting biomedical knowledge from text (e.g. research papers) to make it easier for scientists to find the information they need.

This personal web page provides links to my [teaching](/teaching/) and [research](/research/) efforts. I've also written a few columns on statistics that are linked in the [writing](/writing/) page. 

**I am looking for PhD students to start in October 2022.** If you are interested in that, or another opportunity, please look at the information [here](/workwithme/) and contact me.
