Hi, I'm Jake Lever, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Helix Group](http://helix.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. My research focuses on extracting biomedical knowledge from published research to make it easier for scientists to find the information they need.

This personal web page provides links to my [teaching](/courses/) and [research](/research/) efforts.
