Hi, I'm Jake Lever, a lecturer in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). My research focuses on biomedical text mining and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in extracting biomedical knowledge from text (e.g. research papers) to make it easier for scientists to find the information they need.

This personal web page provides links to my [teaching](/teaching/) and [research](/research/) efforts. I've also written a few columns on statistics that are linked in the [writing](/writing/) page.

**We are currently hiring for a postdoctoral researcher to work on synthetic medical records and information extraction**. The deadline is November 29th. Please see the [job advert](https://my.corehr.com/pls/uogrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.jobspec?p_id=098788) for more information and drop me an [email](mailto:jake.lever@glasgow.ac.uk) if you like more details.
